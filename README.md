## Overview of the analysis:

The analysis was created to see how viable a bikeshare business would be for Des Moines, Iowa. This analysis would be used to get potential investors to buy into funding this bikeshare program.
The analysis uses data from a bikeshare company called "CitiBike" in New York City to create the proposal. Different metrics are visually graphed to build a case for how a bikeshare might work in Des Moines, and to answer any questions the investors might have.

## Results:

### Visualizations
To begin, we will establish the questions that we would like answered. This takes into consideration that New York City is very different in terms of population, but intrinsic details can be pulled out that carry over to Des Moines. Furthermore, the data was kept exclusively to the month of August in 2019, which for either city would be the busiest time of year.
These questions are:

- How many people used the bikesharing program in August and what were peak hours.

- Where are people more likely to use a bikeshare program by visuizing start and end locations.

- Who these people generally are using a basic metric of gender.

- How long were the bikes being used and by which gender the most.

- Overall how many trips were being taken and then drilling this analysis further down by gender.

- A breakdown between a one time customer and a subscriber to the program drilled down to gender and weekday.

#### Amount of rides and peak hours for August 2019

* The amount of rides for August 2019 tallied up to an astonishing 2,344,224 rides in that month. While the numbers may not be that high for Des Moines, the point established is that August was a busy month. With this data, we can then breakdown how busy was it on average over the course of a full day. The two groups of selected bars showcases that 7-10am and 4-7pm were the busiest blocks of time.
